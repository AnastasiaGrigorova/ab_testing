# A/B Testing Analysis for E-commerce Website Optimization

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of A/B testing to support data-driven decisions in website optimization for an e-commerce company. By analyzing test data, we evaluate changes to the website that may enhance conversion rates, order sizes, click-through rates, and other key performance metrics.

### Project Objectives
- **Hypothesis Prioritization**: Evaluate and prioritize hypotheses to focus on the most impactful changes
- **A/B Test Execution**: Analyze the performance of test groups
- **Insight Generation**: Draw actionable insights to optimize website design and marketing strategies

### Tools and Technologies
- **Data Processing & Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing with A/B test metrics evaluation
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn for visual insights on test results

### Project Stages
1. **Data Overview** - Assess data quality and identify key issues
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Clean and prepare data for analysis
3. **Hypothesis Prioritization** - Rank hypotheses based on the RICE framework
4. **A/B Test Analysis** - Compare metrics between control and test groups
5. **Findings** - Present insights and recommendations for optimization
